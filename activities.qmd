## Past Activities

### May 29, 2024 - Annual Dinner at Dutch's Daughter

The official yearly GOE celebration/recognition dinner will be at Dutch's Daughter, May 29.  Gathering time starts at 6:00 PM, a full dinner is provided, and it’s free (although donations to the GOE to support Scouting in Frederick County are welcomed and encouraged).  We need to start getting a head count NOW so, if you plan to attend, please let us now ASAP.  All Eagles are invited, whether they are members or not, but we particularly want to celebrate the achievement of those Scouts who received their Eagle rank this year. We will be sending out an email to all Troop Scoutmasters and Committee Chairs to invite all Eagle youth, but if you are a member of a unit, you can help to spread the word and let them know about the dinner if they are interested.

### July 4, 2024 - Scouting in Baker Park

This is a great opportunity to at least see what Frederick County Scouting is doing.  If you want to help, please *contact us - need to figure out how to do this without exposing names and email addresses*.  If you just want to come down and see what is going on, that’s fine, too.

### February 17, 2024 - Happy Hour at Attaboy Brewery

On February 17, we had a social gathering at the Attaboy Brewery in East Frederick.  We had 11 members attend, which was about 28% of our membership.  This was very successful and all who attended had a great time.
