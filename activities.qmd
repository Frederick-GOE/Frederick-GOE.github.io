## Upcoming Activities

### September 13, 2025 @ 6:30 PM - Fall dance fling with instruction

Want to brush up on your dance step? Then why not plan to attend our Fall Dance on **Saturday, September 13** at [The Lodge Event Center at Homewood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dkc4zmyBNqeuJXmz7) beginning at 6:30 PM! A dance instructor will be on hand to review and/or introduce the jitterbug, cha-cha, fox trot and waltz.

You can invite your children and grandchildren to attend, too. Dress is casual, and refreshments will be served. Try to bring a dance partner to the event. Some local Eagle Scouts will be invited. Call **Fred Broadrup** at (301) 606-1878 and leave a voice message with the number in your party if you'd like to attend.

If you enjoy this dance format, we can repeat the event during the year to add new dance steps and review prior ones.
