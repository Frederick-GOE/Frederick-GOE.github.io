## Upcoming Activities

### May 21, 2026 @ 6:00 PM - Annual Dinner at Dutch's Daughter

The official yearly GOE celebration/recognition dinner will be at [Dutch's Daughter](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PepRyocW7NrqqNvAA), on May 21.  Gathering time starts at 6:00 PM, a full dinner is provided, and it’s free (although donations to the GOE to support Scouting in Frederick County are welcomed and encouraged). We need to start getting a head count NOW so, if you plan to attend, please send us an email ASAP to [membership@frederickeagles.com](mailto:membership@frederickeagles.com). All Eagles are invited, whether they are members or not, but we particularly want to celebrate the achievement of those Scouts who received their Eagle rank this year. We have sent out an email to all Troop Scoutmasters and Committee Chairs to invite all Eagle youth, but if you are a member of a unit, you can help to spread the word and let them know about the dinner if they are interested.
